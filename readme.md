# A random maze generator and solver using AI algorithms.
This it to help people understand how AI algorithms work in an interactive and fun way.

It contains multiple AI Search Algorithms:
Choose from eight different search methods to solve the maze:

1)DFS (Depth-First Search)
2)BFS (Breadth-First Search)
3)A*
4)Greedy Best-First Search
5)Dijkstra's Algorithm
6)Bidirectional Search 
7)Jump Point Search (JPS)
8)Fringe Search


## Prerequisite
Python

## How to run
while in the file directory run the file using 
"python maze.py".

Enjoy.
